    <string name="history">
        The history of sports extends back
to the Ancient world. The physical
activity that developed into sports
had early links with ritual, warfare
and entertainment.

Study of the history of sport can
teach lessons about social changes
and about the nature of sport itself,
as sport seems involved in the
development of basic human skills

As one delves further back in history,
dwindling evidence makes theories
of the origins and purposes of sport
more and more difficult to support.
